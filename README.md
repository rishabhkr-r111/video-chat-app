# Video Chat App

## Introduction

This project endeavors to develop a video chat application that not only ensures real-time communication but also prioritizes security, scalability, and user experience. By integrating WebRTC and Socket.IO along with a robust backend powered by Python and Flask, the aim is to create a platform that provides users with a reliable, interactive, and feature-rich experience. Our project utilizes React for the frontend and Python Flask for the backend, integrating both seamlessly to deliver a robust and dynamic user experience.
